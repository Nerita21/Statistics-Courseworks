The data derives from a field experiment, where soil received two types of rain manipulation.
Treat1 was an old treatment, which happened several years ago before sampling. “X” means an extreme drought, and “C” is the control. 
Treat2 is a constant treatment, where from “W1” to “W4” an increasing drought stress is applied.
All treatments are done in 6 parallels, named as “Blocks”. So altogether there are 2*4*6=48 samples.
The data itself contains coverage values of the plants in each plot in form of percentages. 100% would mean that the plot is totally covered by plants. The sum of the coverage values can be different in the samples, but it is not a problem, hence it is also an effect of the treatments, how big part of the plot are covered by plants.
The scientific question is the following: is there any effect of the treatments on the plant community composition? It is also important to check if the parallels are designed in a correct way, thus parallels have no effect on community composition.
To answer this question, please do the followings:
1, Import the data file to R.
2, Decide whether a standardisation is needed, and write down your arguments!
3, Perform an ordination to visualize nicely the relations of all the samples on a 2-dimensional scatterplot. (a) First decide, what kind of ordination method you would like to use and write down your arguments. (b) Perform the ordination itself. (c) Prepare a nice 2-dimensional scatterplot using ggplot. Use shapes colours and hulls/ellipses for the different treatments! Don’t forget to evaluate the goodness of the ordinations with the learned methods, and add those numbers to the figures/scatterplots, which describe the goodness of the ordinations.
4, Finally test, if there is any significant difference among the samples based on the first and second treatments or among the parallels (blocks).
Include all these results in your report with adequate explanations!
